### Introduction
Hey there, fellow CodeBeasts! Welcome to the “How I Build My Flutter Mobile Applications: Essential Techniques and Features for Modern App Development” series. Whether you’re a newbie or a coding whiz, this series is your ultimate guide to crafting amazing mobile apps with Flutter.

In this comprehensive series, I’ll take you through every step of building a professional, responsive, and high-performing mobile app using Flutter. We’ll start with setting up your Flutter application and move on to implementing advanced features like notifications, deep linking, caching, state management, testing, and much more.

As you know, there are many ways to solve problems with code, and the same goes for Flutter. The techniques I’ll share are how I do things, based on my accumulated knowledge in building Flutter mobile applications.

Let’s embark on this exciting journey together and unlock the full potential of Flutter to create mobile applications that stand out.

### Why this series?
Why this series, you ask? Think of it as a guide on “What I Wish I Knew Before Starting My First Flutter Mobile App.” Recently, while working on a new project, I searched for a Flutter template that included everything needed for a professional app. Finding nothing that fully met my needs, I decided to create my own and document the entire process. That’s how this blog series was born. By the end of this course, you’ll have a comprehensive Flutter mobile app template that you can use for all your projects.

> I strongly believe this series will be a game-changer for many mobile developers who want to build apps for projects where they have the freedom to choose their stack. I’ll justify my choice of packages and techniques and even cover alternatives. 

Enough of the backstory—let’s dive in and start building something amazing together!

### What You’ll Learn

In this action-packed series, you’ll go from setting up your Flutter application to implementing advanced features like notifications, deep linking, caching, state management, testing, and much more. Each article is loaded with step-by-step guides, code snippets, and pro tips to keep you on track. Here’s a sneak peek (List may be subject to change as the course grows):

1. Setup Flutter Application: Get your Flutter environment up and running without a hitch.
2. Adding Custom Icons and Splash Screens: Make your app’s first impression count with custom icons and splash screens.
3. Theming Your App: Style your app with a consistent and appealing theme.
4. Setting Up Routing with GoRouter: Master navigation with efficient routing techniques.
5. App Screen Responsiveness: Ensure your app looks great on all screen sizes—from tiny to huge.
6. Setting Up Logging in Flutter Application: Keep track of your app’s activities like a pro.
7. State Management with Bloc: Manage state efficiently and build scalable, maintainable apps.
8. Caching and Secure Storage (Persisting Data): Securely store data and improve app performance with caching.
9. Setting Up Firebase Flutter Application (Android App Signing): Integrate Firebase and sign your Android app smoothly.
10. FCM Notifications (Background and In-app Notifications): Keep your users engaged with Firebase Cloud Messaging notifications.
11. AWS Amplify for Notifications: Explore AWS Amplify as an alternative for managing notifications.
12. Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics (Bug Tracker Integration): Track user behavior and catch bugs with Firebase.
13. Deep Linking: Enhance user navigation with deep linking.

### Prerequisites for This Course Series

Before diving into this course series, there are a few prerequisites to ensure you get the most out of it:

1. **Setting Up a Flutter Environment**
   To start, you'll need to set up your Flutter environment. Follow this comprehensive guide to get everything in place:  
   [Set up your Flutter environment - Your first Flutter app](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-codelab-first#1)

2. **Intermediate-Level Expertise (can at least build a calculator app)**
   If you've never written a line of Flutter or Dart code, don't worry! I've compiled some useful content to get you started. You'll need to learn the building blocks of any production Flutter app. Here’s a basic version of that list:

   - **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with Dart**  
      Having a grasp of Dart is essential for building Flutter applications. A complete and detailed Dart course supported by examples can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3JuuYuOUK4). You can practice Dart with [DartPad](https://dartpad.dev), an open-source tool that lets you play with the Dart language in any modern browser.

   - **Design Systems: Material and Apple Design(Cupertino)**  
       Creating user-friendly interfaces requires an understanding of design principles. Material Components for Flutter unite design and engineering with a library of components that ensure a consistent user experience across apps and platforms. These components are updated to align with Google’s front-end development standards and are available for Android, iOS, and the web. To get started with Material Design in Flutter, you can check out the [Material Design for Flutter documentation](https://m3.material.io/develop/flutter) and the [Flutter Material Components guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/widgets/material).
    
        On the other hand, Cupertino widgets are designed to provide a consistent iOS look and feel. If you're targeting iOS users or want your app to have an iOS-style design, you'll need to familiarize yourself with Cupertino widgets. You can learn about Cupertino widgets in the [Flutter Cupertino Widgets guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/widgets/cupertino) and the [Apple Design guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/overview/themes/).

   - **Flutter Widgets**  
      In Flutter, everything is a widget. The more familiar you are with them, the better you’ll become as a Flutter developer. Explore the extensive library of widgets [here](https://docs.flutter.dev/reference/widgets).

   - **State Management and Architectures**  
      Managing the state is crucial for Flutter apps. While Flutter's built-in state management works well, [several third-party libraries](https://docs.flutter.dev/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/options), like [Bloc](https://bloclibrary.dev), [Provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider), [Riverpod](https://riverpod.dev), [Stacked](https://stacked.filledstacks.com/docs/getting-started/overview/), [GetX](https://pub.dev/packages/get) etc, offer more functionality. Understanding the architectural pattern you choose is important as it influences many decisions in building your app.

Master these areas, and you'll be well on your way to becoming a Flutter pro. For more foundational knowledge, check out my previous article, "What I Wish I Knew Before Starting Flutter Mobile Development," where I detail some basic insights about Flutter.
