**Title:**
Cracking the Two Pointer Technique

**Description:**
In this comprehensive guide to the Two Pointer Technique, we'll explore one of the most fundamental algorithmic patterns in coding interviews. The Two Pointer approach is an elegant way to solve array and string problems with improved time complexity. We'll cover various scenarios where this technique shines, from solving simple problems like finding pairs in a sorted array to more complex challenges like three-sum problems and palindrome verification. By the end of this article, you'll have a solid understanding of when and how to apply the Two Pointer Technique effectively in your coding interviews.

### Learning Approach

To master the Two Pointer Technique, we'll follow a structured learning path:

1. **Understanding the Basics**
   We'll start by introducing what two pointers technique is and how it works.

2. **Problem Walkthrough**
   Let's solve a classic problem with the technique:

   **Brute Force Solution:**

   - Use nested loops to check every possible pair
   - Time Complexity: O(n²)
   - Space Complexity: O(1)

   **Two Pointer Solution:**

   - Use left and right pointers to efficiently navigate the sorted array
   - Time Complexity: O(n)
   - Space Complexity: O(1)

3. **Pattern Recognition**
   After solving this initial problem, we'll break down:

   - Key characteristics that suggest using two pointers
   - Common variations of the technique
   - How to adapt the pattern for different problem types

4. **Practice Problems**
   We'll solve a variety of problems that use the two pointer technique:
   Each problem will reinforce the pattern while introducing new twists and considerations.

### Why This Approach Works

This learning structure helps you:

- Build intuition by comparing solutions
- Understand the efficiency gains
- Recognize pattern applicability in new problems
- Develop a systematic approach to problem-solving

In the following sections, we'll dive deep into each part of this approach, starting with our example problem...

### Introduction

The Two Pointer Technique is a fundamental problem-solving pattern that can transform brute force solutions into elegant, efficient algorithms. At its core, this technique involves using two pointers to traverse through data (usually an array or string) in a coordinated way, often reducing the time complexity from O(n²) to O(n).

#### Types of Two Pointer Patterns

There are two main variations of the two pointer technique:

1. **Opposite Ends Pattern**

   - Pointers start from both ends and move toward each other
   - Perfect for sorted arrays or palindrome checks
   - Examples: Two Sum in sorted array, Container With Most Water

2. **Same Direction Pattern**
   - Both pointers move in the same direction at different paces
   - Often used for linked list problems or finding patterns in sequences
   - Examples: Fast and slow pointers for cycle detection, sliding window

#### Common Applications

The technique is particularly effective for:

- Finding pairs in sorted arrays
- Detecting cycles in linked lists
- String palindrome verification
- Three sum problems
- Removing duplicates from sorted arrays
- Finding subarrays with specific properties
- Partitioning arrays (like Dutch National Flag problem)

### Conclusion

Now that you have both apps running, you’ll realize that VGV did a good job of adding splash screens and app icons but that’s not what we want. I’m going to walk you through how to have custom app icons and splash screens.
