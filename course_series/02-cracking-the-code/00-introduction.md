### Introduction

Coding challenges can feel like a whirlwind of algorithms, data structures, and ticking clocks, right? But here’s the good news: most of those tricky problems are actually built on just a few core patterns. Once you understand these patterns, you’ll be able to tackle all kinds of problems with a lot more confidence and ease.

In this series, “Cracking the Code: Mastering Patterns for Coding Challenges,” I’m going to walk you through the key patterns you need to know to solve interview questions like a pro. We’ll cover everything from sliding windows to dynamic programming, backtracking, and more. I’ll show you how to spot each pattern and how to apply it effectively when you’re solving problems.

The goal is simple: I want to help you think smarter, practice more efficiently, and feel ready for anything when it’s time for your interview. So, let’s dive in together and turn coding challenges into something fun and rewarding. Ready to get started?

### Why this series?

A few years ago, I found myself in the interview pipeline for some top tech companies. Like most software engineers aiming for the big bucks, I had to face the unavoidable: algorithm tests. Two rounds of them, to be exact. These tests were intimidating, and acing them was a must if I wanted to land the job.

It didn’t take long to realize that the sheer volume of practice questions could be overwhelming, and it felt nearly impossible to cover everything. I decided to tackle the “Blind 75” LeetCode questions, a curated list recommended by several YouTubers as an efficient way to prepare. But even with this streamlined approach, I often found myself wondering if I was truly preparing effectively or just going through the motions. It was a draining process, and I realized many others faced the same fatigue.

That’s why, in this series, my focus is on something different: understanding the key patterns behind coding interview questions. When you can recognize these underlying patterns, each problem becomes less of a hurdle and more of an exercise in applying known concepts. Rather than memorizing answers to hundreds of questions, you’ll learn to decode problems using these patterns, which serve as your guide through the often-intimidating landscape of coding interviews.

### Prerequisites for This Course Series

Before diving into this course series, you’ll need to have some familiarity with the following :

1.  **Familiarity with data structure**
    You need to have some knowledge of data structures in at least one of these programming languages, Python or Javascript since we are going to be using the two in this course but this shouldn't scare you away if that's not what you want. You can still follow along! Here's a list of some popular data structures:

    - Arrays
    - Linked lists
    - Hash maps
    - Stacks
    - Queues
    - Heaps
    - Trees
    - Graphs

    _Follow these resources to get started:_

    - [Learn data structures and Algorithms by Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/dsa) has some good content on DSA. Note that you don't need to learn everything on there, just focus on the data structures.
    - [Python data structures](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-data-structures/)
    - [Data structures in Javascript](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/data-structures-in-javascript-with-examples/)

2.  **Big-O notation**
    In addition, you’ll need to be familiar with Big-O notation for complexity analysis. Lastly, you need to know the basics of object-oriented programming, such as declaring class instances, defining methods in classes, calling them, and so on.
        *Resources to learn Big-O notation and analyses:*
        - [Big O Notation Tutorial – A Guide to Big O Analysis
    ](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/analysis-algorithms-big-o-analysis/) by Geekforgeeks - CS Dojo's video on the [Introduction to Big O Notation and Time Complexity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6xkbGLQesk)
3.  **Object-oriented Programming**
    Since we'll be using Python and Javascript mainly in this course since these are popular and are in high demand, it is very important to know how object-oriented programming is implemented. Here are some resources to help with that:
    - [Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/object-oriented-programming-javascript/) Kedar Makode on freeCodeCamp.
    - [Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/) by Real Python.
    - [How to Use Object-Oriented Programming in Python – Explained With Examples](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-oop-in-python/) by Damilola Oladele on freeCodeCamp.

### Let's learn!
